# üèà SportsEdge - Project Rules and Findings

## üìã **PROJECT RULES**

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain at least 60% test coverage across the codebase
- **Mock External APIs**: All tests must mock external API endpoints (e.g., Yahoo, Action Network)
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for all external API calls
- **Logging**: Use comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Documentation**: Keep README and roadmap files up to date as work progresses

### **Development Workflow**
- **Step-by-Step Approach**: Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Complete First Item**: Focus on completing the first item before moving to the next
- **Background Processes**: Use scripts to start both API and frontend servers simultaneously
- **Network Access**: Ensure dashboard is accessible from local network devices
- **Cron Job Management**: Use dedicated scripts for setting up and managing cron jobs

### **API Design Principles**
- **Fresh Instances**: Create new instances for each API request to prevent caching issues
- **Consistent Imports**: Use default imports for API services across all components
- **Error Responses**: Return meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Data Validation**: Validate input parameters and handle missing data gracefully
- **CORS Support**: Enable cross-origin requests for frontend integration

### **Data Management**
- **Timezone Awareness**: Handle datetime objects with proper timezone information
- **Data Freshness**: Implement automated data collection with failover protection
- **Status Tracking**: Use timestamp files to monitor job execution status
- **Fallback Logic**: Provide fallback data when requested data is not available
- **Data Integrity**: Verify data quality and consistency across different seasons/weeks

## üî¨ **RESEARCH FINDINGS**

### **ELO Rating System Performance**
- **Primary System**: Simple Elo with environmental adjustments
- **Brier Score**: 0.237 (excellent calibration)
- **Accuracy**: 60.3% (realistic, professional-grade performance)
- **Games Processed**: 854 games across 3 seasons (2022-2024, proper walk-forward backtesting)
- **Environmental Factors**: Travel and QB adjustments provide meaningful improvements
- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Proper walk-forward methodology implemented
- **Recommendation**: Use Simple Elo as the primary prediction system

### **Feature Impact Analysis**
- **High Impact Features** (‚â•0.1% improvement):
  - Environmental adjustments (+0.8% improvement)
  - Home field advantage (+0.3% improvement)
  - Weather conditions (+0.2% improvement)
  - Travel distance (+0.1% improvement)

- **Low Impact Features** (<0.1% improvement):
  - **Injury data adjustments (+0.02% improvement)**
  - Turnover analysis (+0.05% improvement)
  - Advanced ML models (no improvement over Simple Elo)

### **Injury Data Findings**
- **Minimal Impact**: Injury adjustments provide only +0.02% improvement to ELO prediction accuracy
- **Below Threshold**: Falls below the 0.1% threshold for useful features
- **Still Valuable**: Data is useful for informational purposes and user analysis
- **Implementation**: Full injury data system implemented for user visibility
- **Note**: While not useful for predictions, injury data provides valuable context

### **ML Research Results**
- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Implemented proper walk-forward backtesting methodology
- **Data Leakage Detection**: Identified and fixed 75.4% accuracy due to data leakage
- **Realistic Accuracy**: 60.3% accuracy with proper methodology (professional-grade)
- **Feature Engineering**: Extensive feature creation and selection
- **Model Comparison**: Tested 15+ different ML algorithms
- **Simple Elo Superior**: No ML model outperformed the Simple Elo system
- **Industry Validation**: Performance within professional range (60-65%)
- **Recommendation**: Focus on ELO system improvements rather than ML models

### **System Architecture Findings**
- **Database**: SQLite provides sufficient performance for current scale
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proper error handling works well
- **Frontend**: React with modern UI components provides excellent user experience
- **Cron Jobs**: Automated scheduling with failover protection ensures reliability
- **Network Access**: Local network accessibility improves usability

### **Performance Optimization Findings**
- **Database Indexing**: Critical for query performance - 9 indexes created for common patterns
- **WAL Mode**: Significantly improves concurrency for multiple users
- **Query Analysis**: Essential for identifying performance bottlenecks
- **Mock Data**: Useful for development but real data provides better testing
- **API Response Times**: Optimized queries reduce response times by 60-80%

### **Frontend Testing Findings**
- **Test Setup**: Jest configuration requires careful mocking of ES modules
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library works well with proper async handling
- **Mock Strategy**: API service mocking is more effective than component mocking
- **Coverage Goals**: 60% coverage threshold is achievable with focused testing
- **Test Performance**: Simple tests run faster and are more reliable than complex ones

### **ELO Visualizations Findings**
- **Real Data vs Simulated**: Real API data provides much more accurate visualizations
- **Early Season Handling**: Special logic needed for seasons with limited games played
- **Data Accuracy**: Actual ELO changes from games are more meaningful than projections
- **User Experience**: Clear indicators help users understand data limitations
- **Performance**: Real data integration improves chart accuracy and user trust
- **Multi-Season Support**: Historical seasons need realistic data generation when API data is incomplete
- **ELO Recalculation**: Users need ability to trigger recalculation for updated data
- **Data Processing**: Different seasons require different data processing logic
- **API Integration**: ELO calculation scripts need improvement to store complete historical data
