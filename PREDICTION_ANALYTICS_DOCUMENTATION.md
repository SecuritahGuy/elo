## Metrics Explained

### Brier Score
**Formula**: `B = (1/n) * Σ(predicted_prob - actual_outcome)²`

- **Range**: 0 to 1 (lower is better)
- **Perfect Score**: 0.0
- **Interpretation**: 
  - < 0.2: Excellent calibration
  - 0.2-0.3: Good calibration
  - > 0.3: Poor calibration

### Log Loss
**Formula**: `L = -(1/n) * Σ[y*log(p) + (1-y)*log(1-p)]`

- **Range**: 0 to ∞ (lower is better)
- **Perfect Score**: 0.0
- **Interpretation**:
  - < 0.5: Excellent predictions
  - 0.5-0.7: Good predictions
  - > 0.7: Poor predictions

### Sharpness
**Formula**: `S = (1/n) * Σ|confidence - 0.5| * 2`

- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- **Interpretation**: Measures how often the model makes confident predictions

### Resolution
**Formula**: `R = (1/n) * Σ(predicted_prob - overall_accuracy)²`

- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- **Interpretation**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between different outcomes

```javascript
const teamPerformance = predictionAnalyticsService.calculateTeamPerformance(predictions);
const bestTeam = teamPerformance[0]; // Highest accuracy team
const worstTeam = teamPerformance[teamPerformance.length - 1]; // Lowest accuracy team
```

### Confidence Calibration
```javascript
const calibration = predictionAnalyticsService.calculateReliabilityDiagram(predictions);
// Analyze how well confidence levels match actual accuracy
```
